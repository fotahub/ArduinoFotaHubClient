# FotaHub&reg; Embedded Device SDK for Arduino&reg;
The FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for Arduino&reg; enables developers to create firmware for Arduino&reg;-based IoT devices that can be updated through [FotaHub](http://fotahub.com). It provides an C99-based FotaHub client library along with a set of examples illustrating how the latter can be used and integrated in real applications.

# Installation
To use the FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for Arduino&reg;, the following tools must be available on your laptop or computer:
* The [Arduino&reg; IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 1.8.13 or later

# Getting started
The best way to get started with the FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for Arduino&reg; is to try out and study the included examples:
* **Simple** - "Hello World" of firmware over-the-air updating with FotaHub&reg; (:construction: *under construction*)

# API Reference
View the [C API reference](src/FotaHub.h) for detailed information about the FotaHub&reg; client library (:construction: *under construction*).
